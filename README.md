This software is created to train players in spellcasting for Hogwarts Seasons LARPs.

The spells are specific physical gestures (similar to fencing movements) and the player should be capable of doing them properly, fast and in proper sequence.

This program requests a person to do spells in random sequence in the specified tempo, thus improving a person's skill and reaction.

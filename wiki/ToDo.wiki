= Bugs =

  * Console works on IE badly.
  * -- FireFox gets slow and doesn't call onload() if image is not available.

= Features =

  * Create top controls to set spells to use, font, colors, delay.
  * Create cookies to store the configuration.
  * Measure spell relative casting time and make delays proportional.
  * Allow control of spells to use by spell and by group.
  * Include Transfiguration shields, Hooligan spells, anything else?
  * + Create publishing script.
  * Create a fancy design.

= Thoughts =

  * -- Maybe get rid of image for a more stable loading in FireFox.
  * + If got rid of icon, remove bottom main() call.
  * -- If not got rid of icon, consider moving whole JavaScript to the page bottom.
  * Remove console altogether, maybe create some another footer.
  * Remove Python version altogether?
  * Think of adding support for fast series.
